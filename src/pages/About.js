        <p>
          After working as a manager, processmanager and consultant for a decade, Ferdy started GHOZT Consultancy in early 2023. While working with different companies, he noticed that the issues he was hired to fix were mostly related to a few core area's:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Processes</li>
            <li>Management</li>
            <li>Collaboration</li>
            <li>People</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, he decided that he decided he could put his skills to work in helping companies to tap in to the full potential of their people. 
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
